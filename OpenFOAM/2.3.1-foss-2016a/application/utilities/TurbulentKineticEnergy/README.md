# TurbulentKineticEnergy

## source
TurbulentKineticEnergy

## Functionality
add read U_mean from a certain const time step (finalTimeStep = pre-calculated mean field).   
calculate the KEMean while letting seperate the part for calculating KE for every specified time step.

## Input
U_mean @ '0.4'   
U

## Output
to be calculated : TTKE total turbulent kinetic energy.

## How

## Limit

# Cope with limit
