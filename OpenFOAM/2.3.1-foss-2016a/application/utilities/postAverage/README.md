## How

## Limit
Not very clear how this works... In the thread there's only a saying about "outputControl timeStep". A simple calculation of mean value between two instances are not right or I'm not using the tool in the right way.   
It calls the fieldAverage library so you will need to understand that library to get all clear.

# Cope with limit
leave it be use instead the ugly version in the post 

# Dig the mine of OpenFOAM
